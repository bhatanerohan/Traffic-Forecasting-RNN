Time Series Traffic Forecasting
Project Overview

The Time Series Traffic Forecasting project aims to predict traffic flow using historical data. By applying state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, we build models that can forecast the traffic volume with significant accuracy. This helps in better urban planning, managing peak hour traffic congestion, and optimizing traffic control systems.
