Time Series Traffic Forecasting
Project Overview

The Time Series Traffic Forecasting project aims to predict traffic flow using historical data. By applying state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, we build models that can forecast the traffic volume with significant accuracy. This helps in better urban planning, managing peak hour traffic congestion, and optimizing traffic control systems.

The "Time Series Traffic Forecasting" project employs sophisticated neural network models to analyze and predict traffic flows. The primary architecture used for forecasting is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units, which excels at capturing temporal dependencies and patterns within time-series data. This choice of architecture is designed to handle the sequential nature of traffic data and is capable of learning long-term trends and seasonality in traffic conditions. The LSTM model is complemented by a series of dense layers to aid in the nonlinear processing of features, optimizing the network's predictive capabilities for accurate traffic forecasting.
